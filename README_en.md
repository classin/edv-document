# Introduction of edv file

The user opens an edv file from Cloud Disk, then ClassIn uses its built-in browser to open the web page specified by the file, only in the user’s own view, not shared with others. The browser can be moved out of the classroom, which is similar to the implementation of Cloud Disk in the classroom.
